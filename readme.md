hey, programmers !!!

A minimal todo web app, made with pure html css and javascript, its not repsonsive now , but ill make it responsive in the future soon.

this is a part of my learning , i have attached all the assets i used in the assets folder.

Tech stack : HTML , CSS , JavaScript

Although this is a simple project still it has some features that can be usefull and can be used as day planner anytime.

Key features:

> It supports refresh , the list doesn't get affected by refreshing the page.

> Simple UI , look and feel.

> Saves the data in the browser , no permissions and cookies required.

i just made this to revise my css and html skills, with the help of a video from GreatStackDev's youtube channel
